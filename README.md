# streamlit_app
The app is made using the python library streamlit which allows the creation of websites from pure python code

# About Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source python framework for creating web-apps for machine learning and data science projects.

The app aims to allow easy to use interface for tweaking and analyzing the performance of classification algorithms on various datasets.
It allows developers to get better intuition about the power of changing the hyperparameters to enhance the performance of model and 
compare it with other supervised algorithms

With time more and more datasets would added.
Currently it supports the MUSHROOM DATASET.
Update 1:
Iris dataset added
Look at the datasets folder for downloading.

#Using the app

* Clone the repository
* Install the software dependencies.
* Download the csv dataset from the link.
* In load_dataset function change the path to the location where your dataset is downloaded
